# Dining Philosopher Problem Solution 


This GitHub repository provides a solution to the classic Dining Philosopher Problem using resource allocation techniques. The Dining Philosopher Problem is a well-known synchronization problem in computer science that illustrates the challenges of resource allocation and concurrency control.

The goal of this project is to ensure mutual exclusion among the philosophers, preventing deadlocks or starvation scenarios. By employing resource allocation techniques, we ensure that each philosopher can access the necessary resources (i.e., chopsticks) in a controlled manner, allowing them to eat without conflicts.

## Features

- **Resource Allocation Techniques:** The solution leverages resource allocation techniques, such as locks, semaphores, or mutexes, to regulate access to the shared resources (chopsticks) among the philosophers.

- **Mutual Exclusion:** The implementation guarantees mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one philosopher can hold a pair of chopsticks at a time and preventing conflicts or concurrent access.

- **Deadlock and Starvation Prevention:** Special attention is given to preventing deadlocks and starvation scenarios that can occur in concurrent systems. The solution employs strategies to detect and handle potential deadlocks, ensuring the philosophers' progress and fair resource allocation.

- **Extensibility:** The codebase is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy modification or expansion to accommodate variations of the Dining Philosopher Problem or to experiment with different resource allocation algorithms.
