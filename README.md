# DiningPhilisopher_Solution
The dining philosopher problem is solved using resource allocation techniques to ensure mutual exclusion, preventing deadlocks or starvation.

The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic example of a problem in concurrent programming. It was originally formulated by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965, and the problem is often used to illustrate the challenges of developing correct and efficient concurrent systems.

The problem involves a group of philosophers who are seated around a table. Each philosopher has a plate of food in front of them, and there are chopsticks placed between each pair of philosophers. The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, and in order to eat, they must pick up the chopsticks to their left and right.

However, the problem is that the philosophers may try to pick up the chopsticks at the same time, leading to a deadlock. This is because if one philosopher picks up the chopstick on their left, and another philosopher picks up the chopstick on their right, they may both be waiting indefinitely for the other philosopher to release their chopstick. This can lead to a situation where none of the philosophers are able to eat, even though there is food available.

There are various solutions to the Dining Philosophers problem, including approaches that involve mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) and semaphores (signals that indicate when a resource is available). The problem is often used as a teaching tool in computer science courses to demonstrate the challenges of developing correct concurrent systems.
